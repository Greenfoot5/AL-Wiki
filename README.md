# Aeon's Legends Wiki Thingy

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To check it builds locally (it won't be merged if it doesn't)

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Contributing Stats
You can either open a pull request editing the appropriate toml file, __with screenshots__ or message me with them.
Screenshots and certainty are required as in the past irregularities have been bugs that needed reporting.
Without knowing that a number has been obtained on a valid drop, this cannot be properly tracked.
This may result in some strange data points, i.e. where a secondary scaled attribute is less then a default.
But what if that's a bug? That's why only certain data may be input.
Uncertain values are for where it's unknown if that's the best, not for estimations.
